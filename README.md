# randomness-detect
A mini-project inspired at Canada/USA Mathcamp 2023; consisting of an adversarial string generator to the "string predictor game" https://openprocessing.org/sketch/802305 (credit to @chonacho for idea and initial code) as well as an evolved "randomness" predictor which uses varying depths of Markov Chains to detect "true randomness".
